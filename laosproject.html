            on Laos than all the ordanance dropped on all countries during WWII.</p>
          <p class="sectionp">Over 270 million cluster bombs were dropped on Laos during the Vietnam War (210 million more bombs than were dropped on Iraq in 1991, 1998 and 2006 combined); up to 80 million did not detonate.</p>
          <p class="sectionp">At least 20,000 people have been killed or injured by unexploded ordnance in Laos since the Vietnam War-era bombings ended.</p>

          <h3>The UXO problem</h3>
          <p class="sectionp">
            <img class="gallerypeople" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tawnywebsite/Tawny/ChildrenLaos1.jpg" alt="Laos Children UXO" style="width:300px;height:200px;float:left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;"> Laos is one of the poorest countries in
            the world today. The people are unable to farm the land for fear of triggering an UXO.</p>
          <p class="sectionp">Many children seek UXO for the value of scrap metal could mean the difference between eating and not eating.</p>
          <p class="sectionp">Many farmers in Laos know their land is contaminated but canâ€™t afford another plot. They simply have no choice but to cultivate their land.</p>
          <p class="sectionp">Nearly 40 years on, less than 1% of these munitions have been destroyed. At the current pace, it will take more than two millennia to clear the country</p>

            up land for farming. As a result, more than a half million people gained land that is safe to walk, play, and work on</p>
          <p class="sectionp">Over the past ten years alone, MAG (mine action organization) has made around 44 million metres of land safe from unexploded cluster munitions, and destroyed more than 180,000 deadly explosive devices. </p>
          <p class="sectionp"> Legacies of War, a Washington-based nonprofit, successfully advocates $12 million for the clearing of UXO in Laos.
